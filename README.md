### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes! I had trouble with small things that got me tuck that will go away as I learn and have more experience

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

   I actually lost a day because of error on holiday so i would just continue doing my work and styling more
  
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Rate limit exceeded was not good just unfortunate with timing
